# pimatic-save
Plugin for saving files to backup media

With this plugin you can save files from the system Pimatic is running to a backup medium. The supported media are FTP and Dropbox.

The save of a file is done via an action rule. The medium independent action syntax is
```
save "[localpath/]filename" [with timestamp] to <SaveFtpDive | SaveDropboxDevice>
```

The optional 'with timestamp' adds a timestamp in front of the filename.
The timestamp format is "yyyymmdd-hhmmss_".
The filename can hold a local path and should the local operating system conventions (linux, windows). When adding an action the existance of the file is checked. The file needs to exist for the rule to be saved.
The base of the filename is the home directory of pimatic. For rpi thats mostly the /home/pi/pimatic-app directory. You could use directory navigation like "../.." in the filename to select files outside the base directory.

To make a daily backup during the night at 1:00 your config.json the rule is
When
  its 1:00
Then
  save "config.json" with timestamp to <your FtpOrDropbox Device>
